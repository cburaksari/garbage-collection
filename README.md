# üß™ Spring Boot GC Load Test with VisualVM, Prometheus, and Grafana

This project is a minimal Spring Boot app that simulates heavy CPU or memory load, useful for garbage collection (GC) analysis and performance tuning. It integrates with **VisualVM** (via JMX), **Prometheus**, and **Grafana** for live monitoring and diagnostics.
